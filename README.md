# USB
- does not have any problems while flashing, because everything is turned off while flashing. That way, there will be no interference.

# TP points
I want them to be near the peripherals I want to test. I also mainly want them for outputs. Inputs pins are secondary, but can be interesting too.

# JTAG and UART
I don't have a debugger, but maybe there is one in my university I can borrow. That way I can actually debug the mouse. There is a built-in debugger in the usb now, but it might have problems because of the spinning wheels.

# placing parts vertically vs horizontally
It depends on how you route the tracks. If the top layer tracks go vertically, the party should be placed horizontally
